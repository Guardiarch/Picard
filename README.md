# Picard
3D Electrostatic Plasma Solver


This is a particle-in-cell plasma code 'picard' was developed by
Jesper Lindkvist and Herbert Gunell with start in 2016 using
resources provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for
Computing (SNIC) at the High Performance Computing Center North
(HPC2N), Ume√• University, Sweden. Jesper Lindkvist was funded by
the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB project 201/15) and
Herbert Gunell by the Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA
project 108/18).

The position and velocity of macroparticles are leap-frogged in time.
Their charge densities are deposited to the grid.
Poisson's equation is solved iteratively on the grid in a central
finite difference manner. The potential at all boundaries is calculated
in the frame of zero E-field (solar wind frame), assuming open boundary
conditions (no charge contribution from outside the domain, and zero
potential at infinity).
